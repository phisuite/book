# Foreword

**Phi Suite** is a project that has evolved and pivot my times over the past years.
But the main vision has always remained the same: **reduce the trade-off between simplicity and quality**.

As data is becoming more and more important with the **AI revolution**, we strongly believe that our main focus should be toward **Data Engineering**.
The quantity of data that developers have to process is constantly increasing. 

To be able to manage this evolution, **Big Data** and complex architectures such as **CQRS** are becoming unavoidable. 
However, this comes with a cost: **an increase in complexity**.

The issue with complexity is that it often results in a **decrease of quality**.
This is why **Phi Suite** focuses in offering **complex solution** with as much **simplicity** as possible.

# Phi Suite
_by Phi Skills_

**Phi Suite** is an **Open Source Data Engineering Platform**.
This project was started to **simplify** the complexity of data engineering.
It was inspired by the **Event Sourcing** pattern.
**Event Sourcing** is a great and radically different way to manage data.
By taking an event-centric approach, it leads to a number of benefits such as the ability to:
- Rebuild any data
- Query data from the past
- Revert data to a previous state
- Fix corrupted data

This pattern will make it possible to offer the following features.

## Features

To be able to overcome as many data engineering challenges as possible, Phi Suite focuses on the following features:

### Big Data Management

Thanks to it's distributed databases and streaming system, Phi Suite enables the possibility to aggregate and manage big quantities of data from various data sources.

### Fast Data Processing

Processes are distributed and executed in parallel, increasing execution speed and accelerating big data processing.

### Automated Machine Learning

Machine learning models are plugged to the data source and automatically retrained to continuously keep them synchronized with incoming data.

### Dynamic API Gateway
    
Every created event, entity, process or machine learning model is automatically plugged to a dynamic API to make it instantly accessible to external systems.
